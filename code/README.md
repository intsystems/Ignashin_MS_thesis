## Overview

The Mountain Aerial Lift Transport Modeling Library is a comprehensive tool designed for simulating and analyzing the transport operations of aerial lifts in mountainous regions. This library aims to assist engineers, planners, and researchers in optimizing lift systems, improving passenger flow and efficiency in mountain transport.

## Features

- **Simulation of Aerial Lift Operations**: Model the behavior and performance of various types of aerial lifts.
- **Passenger Flow Analysis**: Analyze the flow of passengers to identify bottlenecks and optimize lift capacity.
- **Data Visualization**: Generate visual representations of lift operations, including 3D models and statistical charts.

## Installation

To install the dependencies, use pip:

```bash
uv venv
uv sync
```
